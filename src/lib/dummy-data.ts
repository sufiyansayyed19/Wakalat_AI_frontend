        content: `Based on the details provided, here is a preliminary analysis of your case regarding theft, assault, and cheating under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860.

### Summary of Findings:
The incident involves multiple potential offences: theft, assault with a deadly weapon, and potentially criminal intimidation. The presence of eyewitnesses and CCTV footage provides strong evidentiary support for your case.

### Potential Legal Actions & Relevant Sections:
1.  **Theft (Section 378/379 IPC):** The act of dishonestly taking movable property out of your possession without your consent clearly falls under theft. Section 379 prescribes the punishment.
2.  **Robbery (Section 390/392 IPC):** Since the theft was committed with the use of a weapon (knife) causing fear, the offence escalates from simple theft to robbery. Section 392 outlines the punishment for robbery.
3.  **Assault with a Dangerous Weapon (Section 324 IPC):** The use of a knife constitutes voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means.
4.  **Criminal Intimidation (Section 503/506 IPC):** Threatening someone with injury to their person or property is criminal intimidation, punishable under Section 506.

### Relevant Case Laws (Precedents):
*   **State of Maharashtra vs. Vinayak Tukaram Utekar:** This case clarifies the distinction between theft and robbery, emphasizing the element of force or fear. The use of a knife in your case is a critical factor that aligns with the precedent set here.
*   **Ankerlal vs. State of Madhya Pradesh:** This judgment discusses the importance of evidence in robbery cases, including eyewitness testimony and recovery of stolen items. Your position is strengthened by having both.

*Disclaimer: This is not legal advice. Please consult with a qualified legal professional for guidance on your specific case.*`
