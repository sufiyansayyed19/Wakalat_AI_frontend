  "summary": "Based on the case details provided, this appears to be a clear case of robbery with violence falling under IPC Section 392. The presence of a deadly weapon (knife) elevates the severity to Section 397, which mandates a minimum sentence of seven years. The availability of eyewitnesses and CCTV footage significantly strengthens the prosecution case. Immediate actions should include: (1) Filing an FIR with detailed description of events, (2) Securing and properly documenting all evidence including CCTV footage within 48-72 hours to prevent loss, and (3) Recording statements of both shopkeeper witnesses. The related case precedents emphasize the importance of maintaining proper chain of custody for evidence and ensuring CCTV footage is authenticated under Section 65B. Given the circumstances, the case has strong merit for successful prosecution. Additionally, you should consider applying for victim compensation under Section 357A CrPC and engaging experienced legal counsel to ensure your rights are protected throughout the legal process.",
